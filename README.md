# lab2

__Note:__ A prerequisite for the javascript labs is that you have the latest [`Node LTS`](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine.

In this and all following javascript labs it is required of you to follow these steps in your terminal, in order to get up and running:  

1. [Clone down this repository on to your system.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)
2. [Navigate to the repository on your system, using the terminal.](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+navigate+using+terminal)
3. Run this command `npm install` by typing it in the terminal and pressing the `Enter` key.

Before you present a lab make sure that when you run `npm run lint` no error show up. If there are errors make sure you fix them before presenting your lab. These errors can quickly pile up so make sure you regularly run `npm run lint` and fix the errors straight away. This way you wont have to go through fixing hundreds of errors the day before the presentation.# four-in-a-row
